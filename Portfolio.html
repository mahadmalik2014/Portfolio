    <h3>
        Senior Program Officer
    </h3>
    <p>
As a Senior Program Officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Policy and Advocacy division, I specialize in developing advanced data analytics to track development finance flows into developing countries. My grant-making efforts focus on establishing a robust evidentiary foundation to enhance public decision-making related to foreign aid and its effectiveness in improving human welfare.

Previously, I led AidData’s Chinese Development Finance Program (2021–2024), where I specialized in tracking and analyzing underreported financial flows to improve the transparency of global development finance. As Research Director at Harvard Kennedy School’s Evidence for Policy Design program (2018–2021), I helped design and execute field experiments aimed at improving labor policies in the Middle East. Earlier, as a Senior Research Associate at the Urban Institute (2015–2018), I led research-policy studies evaluating urban public transport interventions and their impact on marginalized communities.




In addition to my current role, I am a Faculty Affiliate at the Middle East Initiative at Harvard University and a Research Fellow at the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan. With over 15 years of experience in evidence-based policymaking across 25 countries, I am committed to leveraging data-driven insights to inform policy decisions. Thank you.
